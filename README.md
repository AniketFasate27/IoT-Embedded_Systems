# IoT-Embedded_Systems

The Internet of things (IoT) describes physical objects (or groups of such objects) with sensors, processing ability, software, 
and other technologies that connect and exchange data with other devices and systems over the Internet or other communications networks.
Internet of things has been considered a misnomer because devices do not need to be connected to the public internet, 
they only need to be connected to a network and be individually addressable.

The field has evolved due to the convergence of multiple technologies, including ubiquitous computing, commodity sensors, 
increasingly powerful embedded systems, and machine learning. Traditional fields of embedded systems, wireless sensor networks, 
control systems, automation (including home and building automation), independently and collectively enable the Internet of things.
In the consumer market, IoT technology is most synonymous with products pertaining to the concept of the "smart home", including devices 
and appliances (such as lighting fixtures, thermostats, home security systems, cameras, and other home appliances) that support one 
or more common ecosystems, and can be controlled via devices associated with that ecosystem, such as smartphones and smart speakers. 
IoT is also used in healthcare systems.
